Dashboard App

This project is a personal dashboard application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to register, login, create and manage notes, and upload/download documents. It also includes functionality to edit and delete notes and documents, providing a storage solution for personal notes and files.

Start the application based on your path [It starts the UI](Ex: \dashboard-app\ ) : npm start 
Start the backend server based on your path(Ex:\dashboard-app\backend\ ) : node server.js

Project Setup
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

You have installed Node.js and npm.
You have installed MongoDB (either local or through MongoDB Atlas).
You have installed Git.
Cloning the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone 
cd dashboard-app
Installing Dependencies
Run the following command to install both frontend and backend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
# Navigate to the backend and install dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Navigate to the frontend and install dependencies
cd ../
npm install

Setting Up Environment Variables
In the backend/ directory, create a .env file to configure your MongoDB connection:

plaintext
Copy code
MONGODB_URI=<Your MongoDB connection URI>
PORT=5000
Ensure you have a directory called uploads/ in the backend directory for storing uploaded documents.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm run dev
Runs both the backend and frontend concurrently in development mode using concurrently.

The frontend will be accessible at http://localhost:3000
The backend will be accessible at http://localhost:5000

Key Features:
User Authentication: Users can register and login to the application.
Notes Management: Users can create, edit, and delete personal notes.
File Management: Users can upload documents, download them, and delete them from the system.
Storage: Notes and documents are securely stored in MongoDB.
Folder Structure
The project structure follows the standard MERN stack separation of concerns:



API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/auth/register	Registers a new user
POST	/api/auth/login	Logs in an existing user
GET	/api/notes/:userId	Fetches notes for a user
POST	/api/notes	Creates a new note
PUT	/api/notes/:id	Updates an existing note
DELETE	/api/notes/:id	Deletes a note
GET	/api/documents/:userId	Fetches documents for a user
POST	/api/documents	Uploads a new document

Frontend Pages
Landing Page: Default page before user login.
Login Page: Allows users to authenticate.
Register Page: New user registration.
Home Page: Displays userâ€™s notes and documents with full CRUD functionality.


Deployment:
To deploy the app for production, you can build the React frontend and serve it via the Express backend.

Step 1: Build the React frontend:
bash
Copy code
npm run build
This creates a build/ folder in the root directory.

Step 2: Serve the frontend via Express:
In backend/server.js, serve the static React files using this code:

js
Copy code
const path = require('path');

// Serve static files from the React app
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../build')));

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../build', 'index.html'));
});
